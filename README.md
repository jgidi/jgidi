# Welcome to my Github profile!

In short, I'm a Ph.D. student in Physics from Chile, and also a programming enthusiast.

As of now I don't have much information posted on Github. However, if you would like to read more about me, you can always visit my [personal page on Plasmas UdeC](https://plasmas-udec.netlify.app/en/authors/jgidi/).

Cheers!
