# Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi there! I'm Jorge Gidi, a Chilean Ph.D. student in Physics with a passion for programming. Currently, I'm delving into the world of quantum-inspired algorithms based on tensor networks during my doctoral stay with the [QUINFOG group](https://quinfog.hbar.es/) at the [IFF - CSIC](https://www.iff.csic.es/), in Madrid.

My scientific interests bridge the realms of computer science and physics, aiming for the efficient simulation of physical systems. This journey started with my Master's, where I explored Vlasov and PIC simulations of kinetic plasmas with the [Plasma Physics Group](https://plasmaphysicsudec.github.io/en/) in Chile at the University of Concepci√≥n. Progressing into my Ph.D. at the same university, I have been working in the field of quantum computing, mainly focusing on variational quantum algorithms. I'm a proud member of the [Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO)](https://www.miroptics.cl/eng/).

On a personal level, I love nature and go on excursions to the mountains as often as I can. Also, as an inherent part of the quest to understand our surroundings, I believe in open knowledge.
