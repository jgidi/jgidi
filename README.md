# Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi there! I'm Jorge Gidi, a Chilean Ph.D. in Physics with a passion for programming.

My scientific interests bridge computer science and physics, aiming for the efficient simulation of physical systems. It started during my Master's studies, where I explored Vlasov and PIC simulations of kinetic plasmas with the Plasma Physics Group in Chile, at the University of Concepci√≥n. Progressing into my Ph.D. at the same university, I have worked in the field of quantum computing, mainly focusing on variational quantum algorithms. Now, I am interested on quantum-inspired algorithms, which I had the pleasure to learn about during my doctoral stay with the QUINFOG group at the IFF - CSIC, in Madrid. I'm a proud member of the Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO).

On a personal level, I love nature and go on excursions to the mountains as often as I can. Also, as an inherent part of the quest to understand our surroundings, I believe in open knowledge.
