# Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi! I'm Jorge Gidi, a Chilean Ph.D. student in Physics with a passion for programming. I'm currently spending a doctoral stay to specialize in quantum-inspired algorithms with the [QUINFOG group](https://quinfog.hbar.es/) at the [IFF - CSIC](https://www.iff.csic.es/) in Madrid.

My journey for efficiently simulating physical systems began during my Master's, exploring Vlasov and PIC simulations of kinetic plasmas with the [Plasma Physics Group](https://plasmaphysicsudec.github.io/en/) in Chile at the University of Concepci√≥n. Then, I started my Ph.D., where I have been working on variational quantum algorithms in the exciting field of quantum computing. I'm also affiliated with the [Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO)](https://www.miroptics.cl/eng/).
